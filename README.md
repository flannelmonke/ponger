## Pong
This is a remake of pong. Work in progress...

I've been doing a lot of research on neural networks.
A new passion I've found hence the lack of commits to this project.
That being said I've decided to return to this project and continue.
Starting with the ball movement. In my initial commit, I decided
to make the ball move using CSS animations.
I have recently realized that CSS is the most annoying thing to do
ever. So instead I decided to use JavaScript animations, the same
method I use for making player movements.

I've been struggling a lot with how to export classes in JS.
Embarassing to say... but I figured out how to do that with
lots of googling and experimenting. (this was never taught in school)
Now I'm focusing solely on making the hit detection function.
This part is a bit tricky because knowing the coordinates of every
div can be a bit confusing. I'm using a function that is able to 
return the coordinates of any element. Now I'm trying to understand
the number it's returning and how to make the coordinates 
relate to the hit detection.
