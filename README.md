## Pong
This is a remake of pong. Work in progress...

I've been doing a lot of research on neural networks.
A new passion I've found hence the lack of commits to this project.
That being said I've decided to return to this project and continue.
Starting with the ball movement. In my initial commit, I decided
to make the ball move using CSS animations.
I have recently realized that CSS is the most annoying thing to do
ever. So instead I decided to use JavaScript animations, the same
method I use for making player movements.

I've been struggling a lot with how to export classes in JS.
Embarassing to say... but I figured out how to do that with
lots of googling and experimenting. (this was never taught in school)
Now I'm focusing solely on making the hit detection function.
This part is a bit tricky because knowing the coordinates of every
div can be a bit confusing. I'm using a function that is able to 
return the coordinates of any element. Now I'm trying to understand
the number it's returning and how to make the coordinates 
relate to the hit detection.

I have finally figured out how to save the ball vector according to hit detection.
Now all that is left to do is, implement a miss detection.
Then finally a score board.
Colours and whatnot will be changed after all the logic is done.
Things I have learned today about JS is the importance of seperating logic from procedural code.
My game.js file should only contain the procedural code/script of the how I want the game to play out.
Meanwhile, my classes.js file should contain all the logic/calculations that are necessary for the procedural code
to "play out."

I have finished the final details of this project such as the scoreboard, giving players time to reset in between rounds and made the ball movement a bit more unpredictable. I am actually proud that I chose to do this project because I learned a lot about JavaScript animations and why I should avoid CSS animations as
much as I can. I also learned how to import JavaScript files into another file as a module. That one maybe took the longest... lol
Overall this project really strengthens my front-end capabilities by making a game that is pretty fun and overall I think pretty to look at. By all means, I dont think this project is original, but I do think it's a start.

## What's next?
Right now I'm coming up for more ideas to improve my coding skills. I am thinking about starting a calendar application, maybe a text editor. I sort of wanna do something in Java again. As crazy as that sounds. I'm not quite sure what to do now because I'm sort of exciting to keep learning about all this. Personally I wanna keep studying neural networks, but those can wait... lol
